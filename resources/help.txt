Rules:
  You live in a small, forgotten village in middle of a forest. Some of the villagers just seem to be villagers and are instead one of the following characters:
  Werewolf, Seer, Cupid, Witch, Hunter, Priest, Midwife, Village Bicycle.


Goals:
  As a Non-Werewolf your goal is to kill all the Werewolves before yo get killed.
  The Werewolf's goal is to eat as many villagers as possible until there are more Werewolves than Non-Werewolves

The first night:
  -Cupid wakes up and makes two people fall in love forever:heartpulse:
  -Priest chooses someone to protect someone who will never be killed at night
  -Midwife chooses two people who become twins. Those two cuties will always be confused, so if cutie 1 would die cutie 2 dies instead and the other way around
  -Same as every night

All nights:
    -The Village Bicycle awakes all the nights and chooses someone with whom she will sty the night. As the the Village Bicycle is not at nome, she won't die if she would be killed, but the Village Bicycle is killed, if the person dies with whom she stays
    -The Werewolves can chat 30 seconds long and discuss about whom they want to kill. Afterwards they get another 30 seconds to vote for their favourite meal:yum:
    -Then the Seer awakes and can name one of the others players. The narrator will tell him whether this player is Werewolf or not.
    -Last but not least: The Witch. She gets told who's going to die so she can judge about this person. Once in a gam she can heal the dying person as well as once she can let die once someone else too

Days:
    -The person(s) who has/have died is/are announced (if there are any)
    -The villagers can discuss whom they want to let die. They have 3 minutes to discuss
    -Afterwards there is time to vote for somebody
    -The person who has the most votes is going to die
    -If there are two or more people with the same number of votes, the narrator is going to decide who will die (randomly)
